# Responsive Portfolio
A sample responsive portfolio website that renders well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

* Using Bootstrap, create your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should:

    * Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

    * Minimize the use of media queries.

    * On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen.
